# 💸 Split-It – Smart Bill Splitter

**Split-It** is a clean and intuitive web application designed to simplify group expense sharing. Built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it helps users fairly divide shared costs like trip expenses, utility bills, or team outings — all within a single browser-based page. Without requiring any login, backend, or database, Split-It offers a fast and lightweight experience that runs entirely on the frontend.

The application allows users to input participant names and their individual contributions, automatically calculates who owes whom, and visually represents the data using a dynamic pie chart. Additional features such as dark/light theme switching, random expense tips, and a print-ready summary make it practical and user-friendly. Whether for friends, roommates, or event teams, Split-It is a smart and accessible tool for everyday financial coordination.
